		<p style="font-size:120%;">Currently, I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Psychiatry at Michigan Medicine. In this position, I use behavioral science (public health) and data science methods to understand addiction, violence, and developmental trajectories. I graduated from the Univeristy of Michigan in 2022 with two PhDs, studying Health Behavior Health Education and Computational Science. Prior to matriculating at UM, I lived in Kenya and Sierra Leone, managing mixed method research projects. I spend most of my free time outside, hiking, backpacking, running and climbing. </p>
