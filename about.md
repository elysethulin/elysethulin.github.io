	<h1>About</h1>
		<p style="font-size:140%;"> I am an Assistant Research Professor at the Institute for Firearm Injury Prevention (IFIP) at the University of Michigan. In this position, I use behavioral science (public health) and data science methods to understand factors which enhance the risk of firearm-related injury in adolescent and emerging adults, variations by intent, gender, and rurality, and ways that technology and online spaces can exacerbate or be leveraged to reduce the risk of harm. I graduated from the University of Michigan in 2022 with two PhDs, studying Health Behavior Health Education and Computational Science and completed dual postdoctoral fellowships in Psychiatry at Michigan Medicine and Data Science at the Michigan Institute for Data Science. Prior to matriculating at UM, I lived in Kenya and Sierra Leone, managing mixed method research projects. I spend most of my free time outside, hiking, backpacking, running and climbing. </p>
